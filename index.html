        <p>
          Calisthenics is dance which incorporates ballet, gymnastics, singing, folk dance, acting, marching, apparatus technique and performance skills. You can participate if you are three years or older. You will join a team and learn modern and fun routines choreographed to music. Our teams train once a week. The training season runs from February to October, but you can join at any time during the year.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Performance Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
          You can expect to dance in one competition and one concert each year. We provide beautiful costumes and you perform in theatres for supporters and, at competition time, a judge.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits of Calisthenics</h2>
        <p>
          By dancing in a Calisthenics team, you will develop fitness, flexibility and strength and your love of artistic movement and music will increase. Your self-confidence will grow and you will make lifelong friends.

          <h2>Kelly Urquhart</h2>
          <p>Kelly is excited to work with new dancers and grow Calisthenics in Sydney. She has over 30 years' experience in dance and has been coaching Calisthenics since she was 14. She spent 22 years with Canadian Bay Calisthenics College in Victoria, where she coached all age groups and soloists. When Kelly moved to Sydney in 2009, she was invited to coach at the newly formed Maverick Academy. Her senior team became State Champions in 2009 and runner-up State champs in 2012. Kelly has prepared dancers for the Australian Calisthenic Federation's practical skills exams. 

          Achievements in calisthenics 

          Kelly represented Victoria three times at the National Calisthenic Championships. She won "Best Club Girl" three times at Canadian Bay Calisthenics College. 

          Kelly credits Calisthenics with helping her form many long-lasting friendships with people across Australia.

          <h2>Lisa Trigg</h2>
          <p>Lisa is famed for her creative and artistic choreography and is a sought after coaching consultant. She led many teams to victory over a seven year coaching career with Aurora Calisthenics Club in Victoria, but what she really treasures is her work with dancers with serious disabilities. It's these experiences that have truly shaped her as a coach. 

            Lisa became a qualified Aus Sport Calisthenics Coach in 2002. In 2006 she received a finalist nomination for  "Most Successful Coach of the Year" by the Victorian Calisthenic Coaches Association (VCCA). In 2008 she was invited to become a member of the VCCA committee. 

            Lisa has performed at many levels of the sport, including the elite Championship Division in Victoria at Robynmore Calisthenics College. Lisa says: "Calisthenics is more than a dance class. Not only do you get to perform on stage, but you learn what it takes to work as a team, develop commitment, form friendships and understand those around you".
